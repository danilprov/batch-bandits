# batch-bandits
Implementation of popular bandit algorithms in batch environments.


## Overview
The project is built upon [RL-GLue](https://sites.google.com/a/rl-community.org/rl-glue/Home?authuser=0) framework, which provides an interface to connect agents, environments, and experiment programs. Note, that [MAB/rl_glue.py](MAB/rl_glue.py) and [CMAB/rl_glue.py](CMAB/rl_glue.py) were adapted to make batch interaction possible.
