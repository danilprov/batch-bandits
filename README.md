# batch-bandits
Implementation of popular bandit algorithms in batch environments.


## Overview
The project is build up on [RL-GLue](https://sites.google.com/a/rl-community.org/rl-glue/Home?authuser=0) framework which provides an interface to connect agents, environments, and experiment programs together. Note, that [a relative link](MAB/rl_glue.py) and [a relative link](CMAB/rl_glue.py) were adapted to make batch interaction possible.
